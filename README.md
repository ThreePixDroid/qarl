# QARL (Quantum Animation Remixable Library) üòé

*Description generated by GPT while we were busy doing more important things.*

QARL is an animation library for game engine.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Attention!** ‚ö†Ô∏è

New project! üí° It surely has some bugs, unfinished features, and odd solutions, but a lot of heart and effort went into it. Thanks for stopping by‚Äîhope it will be enjoyed! üôè‚ú®

## Why QARL? üèéÔ∏èüí®

Looking for performance? QARL's FromTo animation computes so fast, it feels like it bends space-time! üí´ No more waiting for slow calculations‚Äîjust smooth, seamless transitions that keep up with the pace of your game.

## Installation

Install the library via npm:

```bash
npm install qarl
```

## FromTo example

```js
const cube3 = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ffff })
)

new QARL.FromTo({
    target: cube3,
    dynamic: true,
    loop: true,
    time: 3000,
    mode: QARL.modes.pingPong, // bounce, yoyo, pingPong
    easing: QARL.easings.outQuad,
    from: { rotation: { x: 1, y: 2 }, position: { x: 2, z: 2 }, scale: { x: .01, y: 1, z: 1 } },
    to: { rotation: { x: 3, y: -5 }, position: { x: -2, z: -2 }, scale: { x: 3, y: .5, z: .5 } },
})
```

## Curve example

```js
const cube3 = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.BoxGeometry(),
  new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff00ff })
)

new QARL.Curve({
    target: cube3,
    loop: true,
    time: 10000,
    mode: QARL.modes.yoyo,
    easing: QARL.easings.inOutBack,
    smoothing: 10,
    properties: ['position.x', 'position.y', 'position.z', 'scale.x', 'scale.y', 'scale.z'],
    points: [
        [-2, -2, 0, .1, .5, .5],
        [ 2, -2, 0, .5, .2, .2],
        [ 2,  0, 1, .1, .5, .5],
        [-2,  0, 1, .5, .2, .2],
        [-2,  2, 0, .1, .5, .5],
        [ 2,  2, 0, .5, .2, .2],
    ],
})
```
